# model-json
`model-json` is a library which enforces a schema on a JSON object.

When the schema is applied to an object, coercion is applied where applicable and keys which do not belong are stripped.
Keys which are within the schema are validated and are either removed, set to defaults, or rejected per configuration.

See usage examples to get started with the library.
